Why you should kill your time if you can use it earn cash! My program is the best solution to save your expensive time!
------------------------------------

A method of time management that helps to isolate the most important and urgent tasks from the entire flow of cases, and distribute the rest of the tasks according to the parameters of speed of their realisation and value. This helps to regulate the workload.
The meaning of the Eisenhower Matrix is mainly to learn how to distribute all your affairs competently, to distinguish the important from the urgent, not urgent from the least important, and also to reduce to the maximum extent possible the time spent on any affairs, the fulfilment of which does not give any significant results.

Every task that could possibly exist?
-------------------------------------

That's right! Every task you've ever created, or anyone else has created or
will create!

How did I look up my data in database?
----------------------------------

All our app tied up on databases. So the best way to show how it works is our database. HERE IT IS

Yeah, but what happens if I lose my databases or app by an excident?
-------------------------------------------------

No problem, my databases exists in another location, than your user app. If you delete an app your data will still exist on your hardware disk, it`s never going away, is it?

Why is this thing so hard in use? It took me half an hour to figure out all the features of the app!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this is just an initial prototype, and don't worry, we will do redesign later so it will be more intuitive in production!

Where do we go from here?
-------------------------

There's lots of potential for the future!

* Make redesign!
* Make more features for tasks!
* Make an account system!
* Make it work with backend server!
