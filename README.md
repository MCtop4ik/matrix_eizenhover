Eizenhower matrix: Never worry about your time again!
==================================

Eizenhower matrix is a revolutionary new time management system that, instead of wasting your time uneffective, helps you to manage your time as an ABC! You'll never lose your time again –my program can settle your tasks in categories! They said 100% use of time was impossible? You're looking at it!

My programm is dead simple to build:


Why you should kill your time if you can use it earn cash! My program is the best solution to save your expensive time!
------------------------------------

π (or pi) is one of the most important constants in mathematics and has a
variety of interesting properties (which you can read about at [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi))

One of the properties that π is conjectured to have is that it is _normal_,
which is to say that its digits are all distributed evenly, with the
implication that it is a _disjunctive sequence_, meaning that all possible
finite sequences of digits will be present somewhere in it. If we consider
π in base 16 (hexadecimal) , it is trivial to see that if this conjecture
is true, then all possible finite files must exist within π. The first
record of this observation dates back to [2001](http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/01/Jun/pi.html).

From here, it is a small leap to see that if π contains all possible files,
why are we wasting exabytes of space storing those files, when we could just
look them up in π!

Every task that could possibly exist?
-------------------------------------

That's right! Every task you've ever created, or anyone else has created or
will create!

How did I look up my data in database?
----------------------------------

All our app tied up on databases. So the best way to show how it works is our database. HERE IT IS

Yeah, but what happens if I lose my databases or app by an excident?
-------------------------------------------------

No problem, my databases exists in another location, than your user app. If you delete an app your data will still exist on your hardware disk, it`s never going away, is it?

Why is this thing so hard in use? It took me half an hour to figure out all the features of the app!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this is just an initial prototype, and don't worry, we will do redesign later so it will be more intuitive in production!

Where do we go from here?
-------------------------

There's lots of potential for the future!

* Make redesign!
* Make more features for tasks!
* Make an account system!
* Make it work with backend server!
